                        Amaterasu: A black flame that can burn anything it touches, even consuming the user’s own body if not controlled. Itachi used this technique to create flames that could not be extinguished by conventional means.<br>

                        Totsuka Blade: A weapon formed by Susanoo, it is a sword that seals anything it pierces in an eternal genjutsu, rendering them trapped in an endless dream-like state.<br>
                        Yata Mirror: Another defensive ability of Susanoo, the Yata Mirror has the ability to reflect all attacks, making Itachi invulnerable to most forms of offense.<br><br>
                        3. Other Techniques

                        Kisame could fuse with Samehada, transforming into a monstrous version of himself that further enhances his strength and chakra abilities, making him a near-unstoppable force.<br>
                        4. Kisame’s Chakra Absorption
                        By using Samehada, Kisame could absorb chakra from opponents, making him particularly dangerous against chakra-based attacks.<br>
                        5. Tailed Beast Mode<br>
                        Kisame also had the ability to gather enough chakra to perform large-scale jutsu and even create a Shark Bomb capable of summoning the power of a Tailed Beast, as seen when he tried to use this power to overpower his enemies.</span></div>

                      <div class="collapsible-body"><span>Deidara is considered one of the legendary members of the Akatsuki due to his exceptional skill in clay-based explosives and his unique approach to combat. Using his ability to mold explosive clay into various creatures and shapes, he could create powerful and highly destructive bombs. His artistic philosophy, where he viewed destruction as a form of art, set him apart as both a creative and dangerous member of the Akatsuki. His contributions in missions, particularly in capturing Tailed Beasts, and his explosive combat style made him a key figure within the organization.</span></div>

                      <div class="collapsible-body"><span>1. Explosive Clay (Bimyou no Jutsu)<br>
                        Deidara’s signature ability is the use of clay that he molds into various shapes, which can then be detonated remotely. He uses mouths in his palms and on his chest to mold the clay and breathe life into it.<br>
                        2. Clay Sculptures<br>
                        Doton: Doryūdan (Earth Style: Mud Cannon): Deidara creates clay creatures, such as birds and snakes, that can fly, attack, or serve as distractions. These sculptures explode on command, making them both effective and dangerous.<br>
                        Katsu: The word Deidara uses to detonate his clay creations. He triggers explosions remotely after they’ve been set.<br>
                        3. C1 - C4 Clay Explosions<br>
                        C1: Deidara’s most basic explosive clay, used to form small creatures, usually birds, that explode on command.<br>
                        C2: Larger and more powerful creatures, including dragons, capable of causing mass destruction. Deidara can also use C2 to launch clay bombs from a distance.<br>
                        C3: A massive clay bomb that can cause huge destruction, such as the one Deidara used to destroy part of Hidden Sand Village.<br>
                        C4: A deadly, microscopic clay explosion that can disintegrate the enemy's cells, killing them with no visible sign of the attack. It’s a lethal weapon with devastating effects.<br>
                        4. Self-Detonation (C0)<br>
                        As a last resort, Deidara uses C0, a self-destructive technique where he consumes his own clay and triggers a massive explosion, sacrificing himself in the process. This attack was used in his final battle with Sasuke.</span></div>
